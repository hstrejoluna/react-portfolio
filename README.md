ðŸ‘‹ I had a background of 2 years of WordPress "Web Master" doing tasks like installing themes, customizing bits of HTML and CSS, edit plugins, manage CPanel and these things, manage db backups... I was the Softaculous App Installer guy.

ðŸ¤“I was one active founder of the dev community called DevHood, participating in many activities as one of the main ambassadors, like TechFest Escarsega 2019, and FliSoL 2019.

ðŸ–¥ðŸ–¥ðŸ–¥ðŸ–¥ before that, I had a Technical Career on Support and Maintenance of Computer Equipment, working as a freelance technician installing Office, mentoring clients, and optimizing the most slowest laptops on the world.

ðŸ¥ŽHobbies:

ðŸŽ¸ I produce music in convergence with my obsession for the Free Software Movement, I only produce music with free software and you can see my releases on the main platforms, as on bandcamp:

ðŸ“£ I'm trying to promote the Free Software Movement and fight misinformation about it.
